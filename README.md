# Triplet Packing Site

This repository presents a web-based interface for experimenting with the triplet_algo packing algorithm from the prtpy library. The algorithm finds groupings of item triplets such that each group sums exactly to a given bin size ‚Äî a variation of the classic bin-packing problem with specific constraints.
Built to make advanced algorithms more approachable, this tool is ideal for students, researchers, and enthusiasts exploring combinatorial optimization.

## Project Overview

This project explores the Triplet Packing Problem ‚Äì a constrained variation of the classic bin packing problem, where items must be partitioned into triplets such that each triplet sums exactly to a fixed bin size.

I implemented and exposed the triplet_algo module from the prtpy library ‚Äî
an advanced algorithmic framework for solving packing problems, including those involving strict triplet constraints.

This implementation is based on the algorithm presented in the paper:

"Solution of Bin Packing Instances in Falkenauer T Class: Not So Hard"
by Gy√∂rgy D√≥sa, Andr√°s √âles, Angshuman Robin Goswami, Istv√°n Szalkai, Zsolt Tuza (2025), 
[Link to paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/18/2/115#)

The site offers two solving strategies:

Backtracking ‚Äì an exhaustive search that recursively assembles valid triplets.

Local Search ‚Äì a heuristic that improves solutions through optimization over a search tree.

To support exploration and understanding, the interface includes configurable logging levels, runtime trace display, and randomly generated valid input examples.

## What You Can Do on the Site

- Enter a list of item weights and a target bin size.

- Choose algorithm mode:

    backtracking: systematic exhaustive search

    local search: heuristic improvement phase

- Select a log verbosity level (e.g., DEBUG or INFO).

- View results formatted as triplet groups.

- Inspect the log stream for step-by-step insights into the algorithm's behavior.

- Use example generator to create valid random test cases.

- Clear the form with one click to start over
